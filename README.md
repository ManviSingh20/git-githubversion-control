# Git, GitHub & Version Control

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes. With Git, we can:
- Track the history of changes.
- Revert to previous versions of code if necessary.
- Create and manage branches for working on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
- Merge changes from different branches back into the main project.

## GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface for collaborating with others on projects. GitHub allows developers to:
- Store code online and share it with others.
- Collaborate with teams through features like pull requests, code reviews, and discussions.
- Manage issues, bugs, and enhancements.
- Integrate with CI/CD tools (like Jenkins), making it easier to automate testing, building, and deploying applications.

*Note - While Git is the underlying tool that handles version control, GitHub adds social features like project management and team collaboration.

## Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, enabling developers to:
- Track the history of code development.
- Collaborate on code without conflicts.
- Keep different versions (or branches) of a project, allowing experimental changes or new features to be developed without disrupting the main project.
- Roll back to previous versions of the code in case something goes wrong.

## Git Commands

1. git init - Initiate a git
2. git checkout -b main - Make main the default branch after initializing the repository.
3. touch <filename> - Create a file.
4. git status - Check which files are in the staging area.
5. git add <fileName> - Adding file to the staging area.
6. open -a <"App name"> <fileName> - Open file with a specific application.
7. git commit -m <"Message"> - Used to commit the files. Here, -m is the message tag.
8. git log - See what commits are made and when.
9. git add . - Add all the files in working directory to staging area.
10. git diff <filename> - Check the difference between the older file and the modified file.
11. git checkout <filename> - rollback or revert back to the last position in our local repository.
12. git remote add <name> <url-of-our-remote-repo> - Tells local repo that we have created a remote repo.
13. git push -u <remoteName> <BranchName> - Use to push things from our local repo to our remote repo.
14. git rm --cached -r . - Remove files from the staging area.
15. 

Note:-
- Working Directory - It is a forlder or directory, where we initialize our git repository.
- Staging Area - It is an intermediate space where we can prepare and organize our changes before committing them to the repository. It acts as a buffer between our  working directory (where files are modified) and the commit history (the permanent record of changes).
- Git Repository - It is a storage space where your project's files and the entire history of changes are tracked using Git.

## .gitignore

A .gitignore file is used in Git to specify which files or directories should be ignored by Git when committing changes. This is useful for excluding unnecessary files, such as temporary files, build artifacts, or sensitive information, from being added to a repository.

We can simply write the name of the files, which we do not want to commit, in .gitignore file. We have to follow the naming conventions.

### Commands

1. touch .gitignore - Create a hidden file.
