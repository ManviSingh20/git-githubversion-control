# Git, GitHub & Version Control

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes. With Git, we can:
- Track the history of changes.
- Revert to previous versions of code if necessary.
- Create and manage branches for working on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
- Merge changes from different branches back into the main project.

## GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface for collaborating with others on projects. GitHub allows developers to:
- Store code online and share it with others.
- Collaborate with teams through features like pull requests, code reviews, and discussions.
- Manage issues, bugs, and enhancements.
- Integrate with CI/CD tools (like Jenkins), making it easier to automate testing, building, and deploying applications.

*Note - While Git is the underlying tool that handles version control, GitHub adds social features like project management and team collaboration.

## Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, enabling developers to:
- Track the history of code development.
- Collaborate on code without conflicts.
- Keep different versions (or branches) of a project, allowing experimental changes or new features to be developed without disrupting the main project.
- Roll back to previous versions of the code in case something goes wrong.

## Git Commands

1. git init main - Initiate a git
2. git status - Check which files are in the staging area.
*Note - The staging area in Git is an intermediate space where we can prepare and organize our changes before committing them to the repository. It acts as a buffer between our  working directory (where files are modified) and the commit history (the permanent record of changes).
